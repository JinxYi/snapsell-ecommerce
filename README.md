## What I Learnt

Snapsell is the first backend project that I worked on in my first year studying Information Technology at Singapore Polytechic. It uses Node.js with Express for the backend, and for the frontend: Bootstrap, jQuery, HTML, CSS and Javascript.

Since then, I have made iterations to the software, adding basic token authentication for strengthened security, and updated the UI to improve the user experience. I learnt to make websites more responsives using Bootstrap and CSS.

Since then I have learnt to structure my project properly, and write reuseable codes. I also learnt how to use some of the chrome developer tools to troubleshoot the frontend.
